# OurSpace

The app in this repository is described in the _Thesis Report_ of _Daniel L. Kurz_

- [_Ourspace: The Efficacy of a Group Dynamics-Based Social Support Application in Increasing Cohesion and Physical Activity_](https://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/20495/DanielKurz2015.pdf), Department of Kinesiology, Kansas State University, 2015.

A journal paper based on this work has been accepted for publication in the

Essentially, the OurSpace web app allows the experimenter to monitor and assist test subjects as they progress through various stages of the experiment. It also allows subjects some form of interaction. For details see the references above.

The design of the server-side code follows the patterns described in [_Enterprise Application Design Patterns: Improved and Applied_](http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/979326/), Stuart Thiel, 2010 (DSRG Master's Thesis).
